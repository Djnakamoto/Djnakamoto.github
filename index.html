        <div class="subheading mb-5">Student-Athlete and Sports Medicine InternðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a short sprinter and hurdler at University of California, Riverside. I compete in the Big West Conference and NCAA as a division 1 athlete. Iâ€™ve been running track since I was 7 years old and I am very passionate about it, but I also look forward to building my identity off the track as well. I am currently a walk-on to the team, but in my second season I have earned a scholarship based on my athletic and academic performance. In my two years on the UC Riverside track and field team, I have broken the 4x1 relay school record four times consecutively. I am also ranked in the top 10 in school history for the 60 meter dash, 100 meter dash, and the 4x400 meter relay. I also hold the title of 4x400 All-Conference in the 2024 season.<br><br>

         I am a second year student-athlete currently majoring in Biology and aspire to become certified as an athletic trainer or sports medicine physician, so that I can give back to athletes in my community. As an undergraduate, I am also an intern in my campus sports medicine clinic as well as Marketplace Physical Therapy and Wellness Center in Downtown Riverside. As an intern, I have a range of responsibilities aimed at gaining hands-on experience and exposure to the field of sports medicine. I assist the physicians, physical therapists and other healthcare professionals in providing care to our patients. This includes preparing treatment plans, escorting patients to the exam rooms, taking vital signs, and assisting with procedures as needed. Building relationships with professionals and my mentors will provide me with valuable insights, opportunities for collaboration, and potential job leads. Working as an intern has been an excellent opportunity to apply my academic knowledge in a clinical setting and gain insight into my future career as a sports medicine practitioner.<br><br>

        In order to become a sports medicine professional, I plan on completing my bachelors degree in Biology while taking summer courses that provide experience in anatomy, physiology, kinesiology, and exercise science. After graduating with a bachelors, I plan on enrolling into an accredited athletic training program to further my education and clinical experience. Once I pass the Board of Certification exam and complete the required clinical hours, I will become certified as an athletic trainer. I hope to work as an athletic trainer for a professional sports team or at a university. In essence, my journey from track and field athlete to aspiring sports medicine professional encapsulates a profound commitment to excellence, continuous learning, and unwavering dedication to serving others in the pursuit of athletic excellence.
